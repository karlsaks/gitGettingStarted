1-	Use the "js/server/seed.js" file to load the database into your computer

2-	Then run node "js/server/serverapp.js" in your CMD 

3-	In your browser go to Http://localhost:8000

	Enter username: karl & password : cedrus2016

4-	Then there are 3 routes : "Get the tweets" , "Check out the founders" , "My Profile"

		*On the "Get the tweets" page you can enter the twitter user you would like to see the tweets

		 deleting founders and memories by clicking on the red button
